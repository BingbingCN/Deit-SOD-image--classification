# SOD Deit image classification

### Overview

This repository is designed for integrating SOD (Salient Object Detection) and Deit (Vision Transformer) image classification algorithms. The SOD model is used to extract hierarchical information from images, while Deit extracts visual features. These features are concatenated and fed into a classifier for image classification tasks.
